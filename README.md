## Tapestry - A Visual Browser History powered by Open Graph

Browser histories are just a list of links chronologically ordered. If you ask me not very interesting or very memorable, and there lies the problem.  

Who remembers a web page by it's url?

Tapestry sets out to change by grabbing interesting content defined by Facebook's Open Graph Standard, and other meta data on the page.  Some day Tapestry might grab microformat tags too for quick searching and look up.
